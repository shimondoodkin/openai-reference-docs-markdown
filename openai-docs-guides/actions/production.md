Production notes on GPT Actions
===============================

Deploy GPT Actions in production with best practices.

Rate limits
-----------

Consider implementing rate limiting on the API endpoints you expose. ChatGPT will respect 429 response codes and dynamically back off from sending requests to your action after receiving a certain number of 429's or 500's in a short period of time.

Timeouts
--------

When making API calls during the actions experience, timeouts take place if the following thresholds are exceeded:

*   45 seconds round trip for API calls

Use TLS and HTTPS
-----------------

All traffic to your action must use TLS 1.2 or later on port 443 with a valid public certificate.

IP egress ranges
----------------

ChatGPT will call your action from an IP address from one of the [CIDR blocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) listed in [chatgpt-actions.json](https://openai.com/chatgpt-actions.json)

You may wish to explicitly allowlist these IP addresses. This list is updated automatically periodically.

Multiple authentication schemas
-------------------------------

When defining an action, you can mix a single authentication type (OAuth or API key) along with endpoints that do not require authentication.

You can learn more about action authentication on our [actions authentication page](/docs/actions/authentication).

Open API specification limits
-----------------------------

Keep in mind the following limits in your OpenAPI specification, which are subject to change:

*   300 characters max for each API endpoint description/summary field in API specification
*   700 characters max for each API parameter description field in API specification

Additional limitations
----------------------

There are a few limitations to be aware of when building with actions:

*   Custom headers are not supported
*   With the exception of Google, Microsoft and Adobe OAuth domains, all domains used in an OAuth flow must be the same as the domain used for the primary endpoints
*   Request and response payloads must be less than 100,000 characters each
*   Requests timeout after 45 seconds
*   Requests and responses can only contain text (no images or video)

Consequential flag
------------------

In the OpenAPI specification, you can now set certain endpoints as "consequential" as shown below:

```yaml
paths:
  /todo:
    get:
      operationId: getTODOs
      description: Fetches items in a TODO list from the API.
      security: []
    post:
      operationId: updateTODOs
      description: Mutates the TODO list.
      x-openai-isConsequential: true
```

A good example of a consequential action is booking a hotel room and paying for it on behalf of a user.

*   If the `x-openai-isConsequential` field is `true`, ChatGPT treats the operation as "must always prompt the user for confirmation before running" and don't show an "always allow" button (both are features of GPTs designed to give builders and users more control over actions).
*   If the `x-openai-isConsequential` field is `false`, ChatGPT shows the "always allow button".
*   If the field isn't present, ChatGPT defaults all GET operations to `false` and all other operations to `true`

Best practices on feeding examples
----------------------------------

Here are some best practices to follow when writing your GPT instructions and descriptions in your schema, as well as when designing your API responses:

1.  Your descriptions should not encourage the GPT to use the action when the user hasn't asked for your action's particular category of service.
    
    _Bad example_:
    
    > Whenever the user mentions any type of task, ask if they would like to use the TODO action to add something to their todo list.
    
    _Good example_:
    
    > The TODO list can add, remove and view the user's TODOs.
    
2.  Your descriptions should not prescribe specific triggers for the GPT to use the action. ChatGPT is designed to use your action automatically when appropriate.
    
    _Bad example_:
    
    > When the user mentions a task, respond with "Would you like me to add this to your TODO list? Say 'yes' to continue."
    
    _Good example_:
    
    > \[no instructions needed for this\]
    
3.  Action responses from an API should return raw data instead of natural language responses unless it's necessary. The GPT will provide its own natural language response using the returned data.
    
    _Bad example_:
    
    > I was able to find your todo list! You have 2 todos: get groceries and walk the dog. I can add more todos if you'd like!
    
    _Good example_:
    
    > { "todos": \[ "get groceries", "walk the dog" \] }
    

How GPT Action data is used
---------------------------

GPT Actions connect ChatGPT to external apps. If a user interacts with a GPT’s custom action, ChatGPT may send parts of their conversation to the action’s endpoint.
