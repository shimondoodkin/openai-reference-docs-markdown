Realtime API

Beta

====================

Build low-latency, multi-modal experiences with the Realtime API.

The OpenAI Realtime API enables low-latency, multimodal interactions including speech-to-speech conversational experiences and real-time transcription.

This API works with natively multimodal models such as [GPT-4o](/docs/models/gpt-4o-realtime) and [GPT-4o mini](/docs/models/gpt-4o-mini-realtime), offering capabilities such as real-time text and audio processing, function calling, and speech generation, and with the latest transcription models [GPT-4o Transcribe](/docs/models/gpt-4o-transcribe) and [GPT-4o mini Transcribe](/docs/models/gpt-4o-mini-transcribe).

Get started with the Realtime API
---------------------------------

You can connect to the Realtime API in two ways:

*   Using [WebRTC](#connect-with-webrtc), which is ideal for client-side applications (for example, a web app)
*   Using [WebSockets](#connect-with-websockets), which is great for server-to-server applications (from your backend or if you're building a voice agent over phone for example)

Use cases
---------

The most common use case for the Realtime API is to build a real-time, speech-to-speech, conversational experience. This is great for building [voice agents](/docs/guides/voice-agents) and other voice-enabled applications.

The Realtime API can also be used independently for transcription and turn detection use cases. A client can stream audio in and have Realtime API produce streaming transcripts when speech is detected.

Both use-cases benefit from built-in [voice activity detection (VAD)](/docs/guides/realtime-vad) to automatically detect when a user is done speaking. This can be helpful to seamlessly handle conversation turns, or to analyze transcriptions one phrase at a time.

Learn more about these use cases in the dedicated guides.

Connect with WebRTC
-------------------

[WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) is a powerful set of standard interfaces for building real-time applications. The OpenAI Realtime API supports connecting to realtime models through a WebRTC peer connection. Follow this guide to learn how to configure a WebRTC connection to the Realtime API.

### Overview

In scenarios where you would like to connect to a Realtime model from an insecure client over the network (like a web browser), we recommend using the WebRTC connection method. WebRTC is better equipped to handle variable connection states, and provides a number of convenient APIs for capturing user audio inputs and playing remote audio streams from the model.

Connecting to the Realtime API from the browser should be done with an ephemeral API key, [generated via the OpenAI REST API](/docs/api-reference/realtime-sessions). The process for initializing a WebRTC connection is as follows (assuming a web browser client):

1.  A browser makes a request to a developer-controlled server to mint an ephemeral API key.
2.  The developer's server uses a [standard API key](/settings/organization/api-keys) to request an ephemeral key from the [OpenAI REST API](/docs/api-reference/realtime-sessions), and returns that new key to the browser. Note that ephemeral keys currently expire one minute after being issued.
3.  The browser uses the ephemeral key to authenticate a session directly with the OpenAI Realtime API as a [WebRTC peer connection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection).

![connect to realtime via WebRTC](https://openaidevs.retool.com/api/file/55b47800-9aaf-48b9-90d5-793ab227ddd3)

While it is technically possible to use a [standard API key](/settings/organization/api-keys) to authenticate client-side WebRTC sessions, **this is a dangerous and insecure practice** because it leaks your secret key. Standard API keys grant access to your full OpenAI API account, and should only be used in secure server-side environments. We recommend ephemeral keys in client-side applications whenever possible.

### Connection details

Connecting via WebRTC requires the following connection information:

|URL|https://api.openai.com/v1/realtime|
|Query Parameters|modelRealtime model ID to connect to, like gpt-4o-realtime-preview-2024-12-17|
|Headers|Authorization: Bearer EPHEMERAL_KEYSubstitute EPHEMERAL_KEY with an ephemeral API token - see below for details on how to generate one.|

The following example shows how to initialize a [WebRTC session](https://webrtc.org/getting-started/overview) (including the data channel to send and receive Realtime API events). It assumes you have already fetched an ephemeral API token (example server code for this can be found in the [next section](#creating-an-ephemeral-token)).

```javascript
async function init() {
  // Get an ephemeral key from your server - see server code below
  const tokenResponse = await fetch("/session");
  const data = await tokenResponse.json();
  const EPHEMERAL_KEY = data.client_secret.value;

  // Create a peer connection
  const pc = new RTCPeerConnection();

  // Set up to play remote audio from the model
  const audioEl = document.createElement("audio");
  audioEl.autoplay = true;
  pc.ontrack = e => audioEl.srcObject = e.streams[0];

  // Add local audio track for microphone input in the browser
  const ms = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
    audio: true
  });
  pc.addTrack(ms.getTracks()[0]);

  // Set up data channel for sending and receiving events
  const dc = pc.createDataChannel("oai-events");
  dc.addEventListener("message", (e) => {
    // Realtime server events appear here!
    console.log(e);
  });

  // Start the session using the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
  const offer = await pc.createOffer();
  await pc.setLocalDescription(offer);

  const baseUrl = "https://api.openai.com/v1/realtime";
  const model = "gpt-4o-realtime-preview-2024-12-17";
  const sdpResponse = await fetch(`${baseUrl}?model=${model}`, {
    method: "POST",
    body: offer.sdp,
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${EPHEMERAL_KEY}`,
      "Content-Type": "application/sdp"
    },
  });

  const answer = {
    type: "answer",
    sdp: await sdpResponse.text(),
  };
  await pc.setRemoteDescription(answer);
}

init();
```

The WebRTC APIs provide rich controls for handling media streams and input devices. For more guidance on building user interfaces on top of WebRTC, [refer to the docs on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API).

### Creating an ephemeral token

To create an ephemeral token to use on the client-side, you will need to build a small server-side application (or integrate with an existing one) to make an [OpenAI REST API](/docs/api-reference/realtime-sessions) request for an ephemeral key. You will use a [standard API key](/settings/organization/api-keys) to authenticate this request on your backend server.

Below is an example of a simple Node.js [express](https://expressjs.com/) server which mints an ephemeral API key using the REST API:

```javascript
import express from "express";

const app = express();

// An endpoint which would work with the client code above - it returns
// the contents of a REST API request to this protected endpoint
app.get("/session", async (req, res) => {
  const r = await fetch("https://api.openai.com/v1/realtime/sessions", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Authorization": `Bearer ${process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY}`,
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: "gpt-4o-realtime-preview-2024-12-17",
      voice: "verse",
    }),
  });
  const data = await r.json();

  // Send back the JSON we received from the OpenAI REST API
  res.send(data);
});

app.listen(3000);
```

You can create a server endpoint like this one on any platform that can send and receive HTTP requests. Just ensure that **you only use standard OpenAI API keys on the server, not in the browser.**

### Sending and receiving events

To learn how to send and receive events over the WebRTC data channel, refer to the [Realtime conversations guide](/docs/guides/realtime-conversations#handling-audio-with-webrtc).

Connect with WebSockets
-----------------------

[WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) are a broadly supported API for realtime data transfer, and a great choice for connecting to the OpenAI Realtime API in server-to-server applications. For browser and mobile clients, we recommend connecting via [WebRTC](#connect-with-webrtc).

### Overview

In a server-to-server integration with Realtime, your backend system will connect via WebSocket directly to the Realtime API. You can use a [standard API key](/settings/organization/api-keys) to authenticate this connection, since the token will only be available on your secure backend server.

![connect directly to realtime API](https://openaidevs.retool.com/api/file/464d4334-c467-4862-901b-d0c6847f003a)

WebSocket connections can also be authenticated with an ephemeral client token ([as shown above in the WebRTC section](#creating-an-ephemeral-token)) if you choose to connect to the Realtime API via WebSocket on a client device.

  

Standard OpenAI API tokens **should only be used in secure server-side environments**.
