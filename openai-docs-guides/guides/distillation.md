Model distillation
==================

Improve smaller models with distillation techniques.

Model Distillation allows you to leverage the outputs of a large model to [fine-tune](/docs/guides/fine-tuning) a smaller model, enabling it to achieve similar performance on a specific task. This process can significantly reduce both cost and latency, as smaller models are typically more efficient.

Here's how it works:

1.  Store high-quality outputs of a large model using the [`store`](/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat-create-store) parameter in the Chat Completions API to store them.
2.  [Evaluate](/docs/guides/evals) the stored completions with both the large and the small model to establish a baseline.
3.  Select the stored completions that you'd like to use to for distillation and use them to [fine-tune](/docs/guides/fine-tuning) the smaller model.
4.  [Evaluate](/docs/guides/evals) the performance of the fine-tuned model to see how it compares to the large model.

Let's go through these steps to see how it's done.

Store high-quality outputs of a large model
-------------------------------------------

The first step in the distillation process is to generate good results with a large model like `o1-preview` or `gpt-4o` that meet your bar. As you generate these results, you can store them using the `store: true` option in the [Chat Completions API](/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat-create-store). We also recommend you use the [metadata](/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat-create-metadata) property to tag these completions for easy filtering later.

These stored completion can then be viewed and filtered in the [dashboard](/chat-completions).

Store high-quality outputs of a large model

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const openai = new OpenAI();

const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4.1",
  messages: [
    { role: "system", content: "You are a corporate IT support expert." },
    { role: "user", content: "How can I hide the dock on my Mac?"},
  ],
  store: true,
  metadata: {
    role: "manager",
    department: "accounting",
    source: "homepage"
  }
});

console.log(response.choices[0]);
```

When using the `store: true` option, completions are stored for 30 days. Your completions may contain sensitive information and so, you may want to consider creating a new [Project](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9186755-managing-your-work-in-the-api-platform-with-projects) with limited access to store these completions.

Evaluate to establish a baseline
--------------------------------

You can use your stored completions to evaluate the performance of both the larger model and a smaller model on your task to establish a baseline. This can be done using the [evals](/docs/guides/evals) product.

Typically, the large model will outperform the smaller model on your evaluations. Establishing this baseline allows you to measure the improvements gained through the distillation / fine-tuning process.

Create training dataset to fine-tune smaller model
--------------------------------------------------

Next you can select a subset of your stored completions to use as training data for fine-tuning a smaller model like `gpt-4o-mini`. [Filter your stored completions](/chat-completions) to those that you would like to use to train the small model, and click the "Distill" button. A few hundred samples might be sufficient, but sometimes a more diverse range of thousands of samples can yield better results.

This action will open a dialog to begin a [fine-tuning job](/docs/guides/fine-tuning), with your selected completions as the training dataset. Configure the parameters as needed, choosing the base model you wish to fine-tune. In this example, we're going to choose the [latest snapshot of GPT-4o-mini](/docs/models#gpt-4o-mini).

![fine tune job](https://openaidevs.retool.com/api/file/ab8d0ccf-df5d-4099-80e1-2f257d82a92f)

After configuring, click "Run" to start the fine-tuning job. The process may take 15 minutes or longer, depending on the size of your training dataset.

Evaluate the fine-tuned small model
-----------------------------------

When your fine-tuning job is complete, you can run evals against it to see how it stacks up against the base small and large models. You can select fine-tuned models in the [Evals](/evaluations) product to generate new completions with the fine-tuned small model.

Alternately, you could also store [new Chat Completions](\(/docs/guides/distillation#send-fine-tuned\)) generated by the fine-tuned model, and use them to evaluate performance. By continually tweaking and improving:

*   The diversity of the training data
*   Your prompts and outputs on the large model
*   The accuracy of your eval graders

You can bring the performance of the smaller model up to the same levels as the large model, for a specific subset of tasks.
