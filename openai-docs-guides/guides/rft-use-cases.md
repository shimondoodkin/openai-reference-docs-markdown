Reinforcement fine-tuning use cases
===================================

Learn use cases and best practices for reinforcement fine-tuning.

[Reinforcement fine-tuning](/docs/guides/reinforcement-fine-tuning) (RFT) provides a way to improve your model's performance at specific tasks. The task must be clear and have verifiable answers.

When to use reinforcement fine-tuning
-------------------------------------

Agentic workflows are designed to make decisions that are both correct and verifiable. RFT can help by providing explicit rubrics and using code‑based or LLM‑based graders to measure functional success, factual accuracy, or policy compliance.

Across early users, three clear use cases have emerged:

1.  **Turn instructions into working code**: Convert open-ended prompts into structured code, configs, or templates that must pass deterministic tests.
2.  **Pull facts into a clean format**: Extract verifiable facts and summaries from messy, unstructured text and return JSON-structured or other schema-based outputs.
3.  **Apply complex rules correctly**: Make fine-grained label or policy decisions when the information provided is nuanced, large in quantity, hierarchical, or high-stakes.

### 1\. Turn instructions into working code

In this use case, models reason over hidden domain constraints to produce structured outputs like code, queries, or infrastructure templates. Outputs must satisfy multiple correctness conditions, and success is usually deterministically graded: the artifact either compiles, passes tests, or meets an explicit schema.

#### Wiring verification IPs for semiconductor design

Use case

> **Company**: [ChipStack](https://www.chipstack.ai) is building the next-generation of AI-powered tools for chip design and verification, aimed at significantly reducing the time and cost of developing and validating complex semiconductor chips.
> 
> **Problem to solve**: One task that's challenging and time-consuming for humans is binding design interfaces to verification IPs (pre-created verification components that, when properly applied, can signifcantly enhance quality and coverage of verification). There are many verification IPs, and each can contain dozens to hundreds of signals that may be mapped. Someone must understand this domain well in order to apply the verification IP correctly.
> 
> **Objective**: To train OpenAI reasoning models to do this instead, ChipStack prepared a dataset consisting of less than 50 samples, then performed several RFT variations. For the final evaluation report, they ran this evaluation set three times against each model and variation—o1-mini base and fine-tuned, o3-mini base and fine-tuned—and averaged the results per-sample then overall.

Prompt

> Below is a piece of example data provided.

```text
[
    {“name”: “BLOCK_SIZE”, “value”: “8”},
    {“name”: “ADDR_WIDTH”, “value”: “4”}
]
```

Grader code

> Below is a grader definition in Python of a string map, represented as a list of objects with `name` and `value` properties.
> 
> Conceptually, this is meant to model a type like `Dict[str, str]`.

```python
{
  "type": "python",
  "name": "donors_caas",
  "image_tag": "alpha",
  "source": "from collections import Counter

def grade(sample: dict[str, str], item: dict[str, str]) -> float:
    # multisets of (name, value) pairs
    predicted = sample[\"output_json\"][\"predicted\"]
    expected  = item[\"reference_answer\"]
    pred_counts = Counter((d[\"name\"], d[\"value\"]) for d in predicted)
    exp_counts  = Counter((d[\"name\"], d[\"value\"]) for d in expected)

    true_pos = sum(min(pred_counts[p], exp_counts[p]) for p in pred_counts)
    pred_total = sum(pred_counts.values())
    exp_total  = sum(exp_counts.values())

    precision = true_pos / pred_total if pred_total else 0.0
    recall    = true_pos / exp_total  if exp_total  else 0.0

    if precision + recall == 0.0:
        return 0.0
    return 2 * precision * recall / (precision + recall)"
}
```

Results

> For both o1-mini and o3-mini, performance improved by ~12 percentage points. The fine-tuned variants got much better about recognizing when not to apply wiring. Many commercial verification IPs can contain hundreds of optional signals, most of which are not meant to be applied.

#### Production-ready API snippets that compile and pass AST checks

Use case

> **Company**: [Runloop](https://www.runloop.ai) is a platform for AI-powered coding agents to be deployed into production and built with public and custom benchmarking capabilities to refine performance.
> 
> **Problem to solve**: Runloop wanted to improve model performance at using third-party APIs, such as the Stripe API, which can be large and complex without a human in the loop. If they could train a model to use the Stripe API, Runloop could turn economically impactful business cases into working code.
> 
> **Objective**: Their goal was teaching the model to master usage of the Stripe API, including writing complete code snippets for arbitrary user requests by either adapting information from existing integration guides, merging information from multiple guides, or inferring information not explicitly stated in the guides. They used RFT with two primary rewards:
> 
> 1.  Reward the model for outputting the answer in a Markdown format that aligns with expectation of how a "dynamic" integration guide should look.
> 2.  Reward the model for producing "correct" code snippets by validating the outputted code via AST Grep. This allows them to confirm the model is making the correct Stripe SDK calls with the correct parameters and in some cases even in the correct order.

#### Correct handling of conflicts and dupes in a schedule manager

Use case

> **Company**: [Milo](https://www.joinmilo.com) helps busy parents manage chaotic family schedules by converting messy inputs—like text convos with to-dos, school newsletter PDFs, weekly reminders, sports schedule emails—into reliable calendar and list actions.
> 
> **Problem to solve**: Base GPT-4o prompting and SFT fell short of trust thresholds.
> 
> **Objective**: Milo used RFT to properly create coding tasks like event vs. list classification, recurrence rule generation, accurate updates and deletes, conflict detection, and strict output formatting. They defined a grader that checked whether generated item objects were complete, categorized correctly, and were a duplicate or had a calendar conflict.

Results

> Results showed performance improvements across the board, with average correctness scores **increasing from 0.86 to 0.91**, while the most challenging scenarios improved from **0.46 to 0.71** (where a perfect score=1).
> 
> "Accuracy isn't just a metric—it's peace of mind for busy parents. These are still early days but with such important improvements in base performance, we're able to push more aggressively into complex reasoning needs."
> 
> "Navigating and supporting family dynamics involves understanding nuanced implications of the data. Take conflicts—knowing soccer for Ethan conflicts with Ella's recital because Dad has to drive both kids goes deeper than simple overlapping times."

### 2\. Pull facts into a clean format

These tasks typically involve subtle distinctions that demand clear classification guidelines. Successful framing requires explicit and hierarchical labeling schemes defined through consensus by domain experts. Without consistent agreement, grading signals become noisy, weakening RFT effectiveness.

#### Assigning ICD-10 medical codes

Use case

> **Company**: [Ambience](https://www.ambiencehealthcare.com) is an AI platform that eliminates administrative burden for clinicians and ensures accurate, compliant documentation across 100+ specialties, helping physicians focus on patient care while increasing documentation quality and reducing compliance risk for health systems.
> 
> **Problem to solve**: ICD-10 coding is one of the most intricate administrative tasks in medicine. After every patient encounter, clinicians must map each diagnosis to one of ~70,000 codes—navigating payor-specific rules on specificity, site-of-care, and mutually exclusive pairings. Errors can trigger audits and fines that stretch into nine figures.
> 
> **Objective**: Using reinforcement fine-tuning on OpenAI frontier models, Ambience wanted to train a reasoning system that listens to the visit audio, pulls in relevant EHR context, and recommends ICD-10 codes with accuracy exceeding expert clinicians.

Results

> Ambience achieved model improvements that can lead human experts.
> 
> On a gold-panel test set spanning hundreds of encounters, reinforcement fine-tuning moved the model from trailing humans to leading them by **12 points—eliminating roughly one quarter of the coding errors trained physicians make**:
> 
> *   o3-mini (base): 0.39 (-6 pts)
> *   Physician baseline: 0.45
> *   RFT-tuned o3-mini: 0.57 (+12 pts)
> 
> The result is a real-time, point-of-care coding support that can raise reimbursement integrity while reducing compliance risk.
> 
> “Accurate ICD-10 selection is mission-critical for compliant documentation. RFT unlocked a new level of coding precision we hadn’t seen from any foundation model and set a new bar for automated coding.”

#### Extracting excerpts to support legal claims

Use case

> **Company**: [Harvey](https://www.harvey.ai) is building AI that legal teams trust—and that trust hinges on retrieving precisely the right evidence from a sprawling corpora of contracts, statutes, and case law. Legal professionals aren’t satisfied with models that merely generate plausible-sounding summaries or paraphrased answers. They demand verifiable citations—passages that can be traced directly back to source documents.
> 
> **Problem to solve**: Harvey’s clients use its models to triage litigation risk, construct legal arguments, and support due diligence for legal professionals—all tasks where a single missed or misquoted sentence can flip an outcome. Models must be able to parse long, dense legal documents and extract only the portions that matter. In practice, these inputs are often messy and inconsistent: some claims are vague, while others hinge on rare legal doctrines buried deep in boilerplate.
> 
> **Objective**: The task’s requirements are to interpret nuanced legal claims, navigate long-form documents, and select on-point support with verbatim excerpts.

### 3\. Apply complex rules correctly

This use case involves pulling verifiable facts or entities from unstructured inputs into clearly defined schemas (e.g., JSON objects, condition codes, medical codes, legal citations, or financial metrics).

Successful extraction tasks typically benefit from precise, continuous grading methodologies—like span-level F1 scores, fuzzy text-matching metrics, or numeric accuracy checks—to evaluate how accurately the extracted information aligns with ground truth. Define explicit success criteria and detailed rubrics. Then, the model can achieve reliable, repeatable improvements.

Evals are the foundation
------------------------

**Before implementing RFT, we strongly recommended creating and running an eval for the task you intend to fine-tune on**. If the model you intend to fine-tune scores at either the absolute minimum or absolute maximum possible score, then RFT won’t be useful to you.

RFT works by reinforcing better answers to provided prompts. If we can’t distinguish the quality of different answers (i.e., if they all receive the minimum or maximum possible score), then there's no training signal to learn from. However, if your eval scores somewhere in the range between the minimum and maximum possible scores, there's enough data to work with.

An effective eval reveals opportunities where human experts consistently agree but current frontier models struggle, presenting a valuable gap for RFT to close. [Get started with evals](/docs/guides/evals).

How to get better results from RFT
----------------------------------

To see improvements in your fine-tuned model, there are two main places to revisit and refine: making sure your task is well defined, and making your grading scheme more robust.

### Reframe or clarify your task

Good tasks give the model a fair chance to learn and let you quantify improvements.

*   **Start with a task the model can already solve occasionally**. RFT works by sampling many answers, keeping what looks best, and nudging the model toward those answers. If the model never gets the answer correct today, it cannot improve.
*   **Make sure each answer can be graded**. A grader must read an answer and produce a score without a person in the loop. We support multiple [grader types](/docs/guides/graders), including custom Python graders and LLM judges. If you can't write code to judge the answer with an available grader, RFT is not the right tool.
*   **Remove doubt about the “right” answer**. If two careful people often disagree on the solution, the task is too fuzzy. Rewrite the prompt, add context, or split the task into clearer parts until domain experts agree.
*   **Limit lucky guesses**. If the task is multiple choice with one obvious best pick, the model can win by chance. Add more classes, ask for short open‑ended text, or tweak the format so guessing is costly.

### Strengthen your grader

Clear, robust grading schemes are essential for RFT.

*   **Produce a smooth score, not a pass/fail stamp**. A score that shifts gradually as answers improve provides a better training signal.
*   **Guard against reward hacking**. This happens when the model finds a shortcut that earns high scores without real skill.
*   **Avoid skewed data**. Datasets in which one label shows up most of the time invite the model to guess that label. Balance the set or up‑weight rare cases so the model must think.
*   **Use an LLM judge when code falls short**. For rich, open‑ended answers, have a [separate OpenAI model grade](/docs/guides/graders#model-graders) your fine-tuned model's answers. Make sure you:
    *   **Evaluate the judge**: Run multiple candidate responses and correct answers through your LLM judge to ensure the grade returned is stable and aligned with preference.
    *   **Provide few-shot examples**. Include great, fair, and poor answers in the prompt to improve the grader's effectiveness.
