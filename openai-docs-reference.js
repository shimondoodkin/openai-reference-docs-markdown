Below is an incomplete list of HTTP headers returned with API responses:\n\n**API meta information**\n* `openai-organization`: The [organization](/docs/guides/production-best-practices#setting-up-your-organization) associated with the request\n* `openai-processing-ms`: Time taken processing your API request\n* `openai-version`: REST API version used for this request (currently `2020-10-01`)\n* `x-request-id`: Unique identifier for this API request (used in troubleshooting)\n\n**[Rate limiting information](/docs/guides/rate-limits)**\n* `x-ratelimit-limit-requests`\n* `x-ratelimit-limit-tokens`\n* `x-ratelimit-remaining-requests`\n* `x-ratelimit-remaining-tokens`\n* `x-ratelimit-reset-requests`\n* `x-ratelimit-reset-tokens`\n\n**OpenAI recommends logging request IDs in production deployments** for more efficient troubleshooting with our [support team](https://help.openai.com/en/), should the need arise.

This includes:\n\n- The REST API (currently `v1`)\n- Our first-party [SDKs](/docs/libraries) (released SDKs adhere to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/))\n- [Model](/docs/models) families (like `gpt-4o` or `o4-mini`)\n\n**Model prompting behavior between snapshots is subject to change**.\nModel outputs are by their nature variable, so expect changes in prompting and model behavior between snapshots. For example, if you moved from `gpt-4o-2024-05-13` to `gpt-4o-2024-08-06`, the same `system` or `user` messages could function differently between versions. The best way to ensure consistent prompting behavior and model output is to use pinned model versions, and to implement [evals](/docs/guides/evals) for your applications.\n\n**Backwards-compatible API changes**:\n- Adding new resources (URLs) to the REST API and SDKs\n- Adding new optional API parameters\n- Adding new properties to JSON response objects or event data\n- Changing the order of properties in a JSON response object\n- Changing the length or format of opaque strings, like resource identifiers and UUIDs\n- Adding new event types (in either streaming or the Realtime API)\n\nSee the [changelog](/docs/changelog) for a list of backwards-compatible changes and rare breaking changes.\n",url:"/docs/api-reference/backward-compatibility",relativeUrl:"backward-compatibility"},{id:"responses",type:"generated",title:"Responses",content:"OpenAI's most advanced interface for generating model responses.
